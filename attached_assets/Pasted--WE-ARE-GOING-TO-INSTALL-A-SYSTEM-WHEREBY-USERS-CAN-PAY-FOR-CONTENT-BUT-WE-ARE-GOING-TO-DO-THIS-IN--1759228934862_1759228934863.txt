 WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL A SYSTEM WHEREBY USERS CAN PAY FOR CONTENT. BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS IN PHASES. THE FIRST PHASE IS TO SET UP A DATABASE FOR STORING USER INFORMATION (USERNAME/PASSWORD AND ALSO MATERIALS GENERATED IN SESSIONS WHILE LOGGED IN); THE NEXT PHASE IS TO MAKE IT SO THAT USERS HAVE THE OPTION (NOT THE OBLIGATION) OF LOGGING (WITH USERNAME/PASSWORD). IMPORTANT: DO NOT HIDE THE SITE BEHIND A PASSWORD-WALL; LET UNREGISTERED/UNLOGGEDIN USERS USE THE SITE. AFTER THAT, YOU WILL SET UP PAYMENTS WITH STRIPE: YOU WILL USE THE FOLLOWING SECRETS: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_LIVINGBOOKCREATOR  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY. YOU WILL USE THE FOLLOWING PRICE SCHEDULE:

AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, YOU WILL DISPLAY THE NUMBER OF CREDITS THAT A USER HAS. AS THE USER USES THE APP, YOU WILL DEDUCT CREDITS ACCORDINGLY, AND YOU WILL DISPLAY THE UPDATED CREDIT-NUMBERS. 

AFTER YOU DO THIS, YOU WILL PARTIALLY PAYWALL THE APPS OUTPUT. LET ME EXPLAIN. FIRST OF ALL, YOU LET THE USER USE EACH OF THE FUNCTIONS (DISCUSS/REWRITE/ETC.) BUT YOU ONLY GIVE THEM PARTIAL ACCESS TO SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU LET THEM USE THE REWRITE FUNCTION; BUT YOU DO NOT GIVE THEM FULL REWRITE; YOU ONLY GIVE THEM HALF OF THE REWRITE. YOU LET THEM USE THE PODCAST FUNCTION; BUT YOU DO NOT LET THEM DOWNLOAD THE PODCAST (SO THEY GET TEH WHOLE PODCAST,BUT THEY DO NOT GET TO DOWNLOAD IT); YOU LET THEM USER ALL THE REMAINING FUNCTIONS (TEST ME, COGNITIVE MAP, SUGGESTED READINGS, DISCUSS, ETC.), BUT YOU DO NOT LET THEM DOWNLOAD THEM. TO DOWNLOAD THEM, THE USER HAS TO BUY ENOUGH CREDITS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
