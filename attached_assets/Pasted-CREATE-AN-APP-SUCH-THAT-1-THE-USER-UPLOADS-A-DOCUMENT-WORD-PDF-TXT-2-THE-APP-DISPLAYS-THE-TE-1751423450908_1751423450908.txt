CREATE AN APP SUCH THAT: 1. THE USER UPLOADS A DOCUMENT (WORD, PDF, TXT); 2. THE APP DISPLAYS THE TEXT; 3. THE TEXT IS SCROLLABLE; 4. ALL MATH NOTATION IN THE TEXT IS PERFECT (REAL MATH, NOT MS WORD PHONY MATH NOTATION); 5. IF THE DOCUMENT UPLOADED HAD PLAINTEXT MATH (OR WHATEVER THOSE FUCKED UP MATH SYMBOSL ARE WHEN THE DOCUMENT CAN'T DO MATH) THE APP CONVERTS THEM TO PERFECT MATH; 6. BELOW THE DOCUMENT IS AN AI-CHAT INTERFACE; THE USER SAYS/ASKS WHATEVER HE WANTS AND THE LLM ANSWERS (YOU DO NOT FILTER THE LLM WITH YOUR BULLSHIT IDEAS); 7. THE AI-LLLM OUTPUTS ITS RESPONSES ON THE RIGHT OF THE PAGE, ON A SCROLLABLE PANNEL THAT IS PARALELL TO THE BOOK-VIEW THING; 8. THE AI OUTPUT PANEL IS SCROLLABLE; 9. THE BOOK IS SCROLLABLE. 10. THE USER DOES NOT HAVE SCROLL TO THE END OF THE BOOK TO GET TO THE AI CHAT INPUT THING (YOU ALWAYS FUCK THIS UP). 11. THE USER CAN HIGHLIGHT ANY PART OF THE TEXT AND ASK THE AI LLM ABOUT IT. 12. THE AI CHAT (AI/LLM THING) KNOWS ABOUT THE TEXT; IF THE USER ASKS HIM A QUESTION ABOUT IT, IT DOESN'T GO 'HUH?'; YOU ALWAYS FUCK THIS UP; SO THIS TIME, DONT' FUCK IT UP; 13. THE AI CHAT THING HAS MEMORY SO THE USER CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE APP, NOT JUST ISOLATED DIPSHIT ONE-OFF QUESTION ANSWER SESSINONS; 14. THE FORMATTING OF THE TEXT THAT IS UPLOADED MUST BE PRESERVED PERFECTLY; 15. THE ONLY QUALIFICATION TO 14 IS THAT IF THE MATH NOTATION IN THE TEXT UPLOADED IS FUCKED UP, THE APP WILL FIX IT AND DISPLAY IT PERFECTLY; 16; THE USER CAN DOWNLOAD A MATH-CORECTION VERSOIN OF THE MATH-FUCKED-UP MANUSCRIPT HE UPLOADED; 1 7. THE USER CAN DOWNLOAD (OR EMAIL TO HIMSELF USING SENDGRID) ANY GIVEN ONE OF THE APP'S RESPONSES TO HIM ABOUT THE  TEXT; SO IF THE USER ASKS THE APP TO GENERATE AN EXAM BASED ON THE TEXT, THE USER CAN DOWNLOADEMAIL THE RESPONSE; 18: THE USER CAN REWRITE THE TEXT, OR ANY SPECIFIC PART THEREOF, WITH CUSTOMIZED REWRITE INSTRUCTIONS; THIS IS DONE VIA A DEDICATED REWRITE FUNCTION THAT WORKS AS FOLLOWS: THE USER HITS REWRITE; THIS OPENS UP A PANEL WHERE THE TEXT IS DIVIDED INTO 500 WORD CHUNKS, AND THE USER CNA HERE SEE A PREVIEW OF THIS 'CHUNKED' VERSION OF THE TEXT; THE USER CAN CHECK OFF THE CHUNKS THAT HE WANTS  REWRITTEDN (OR HE CAN JUST HIT 'SELECT ALL' TO REWRITE THE WHOLE THING); AND HE THEN IT REWRITES THOSE CHUNKS (ONE CHUNK AT A TIME TO AVOID TOKEN LIMIT ERRORS); 19. THE USER CAN CHOOSE WHICH LLM TO USE (DEEPSEEK, OPENAI, ANTHROPIC, PERPLEXITY) 20 THE DEFAULT LLM IS DEEPSEEK.
