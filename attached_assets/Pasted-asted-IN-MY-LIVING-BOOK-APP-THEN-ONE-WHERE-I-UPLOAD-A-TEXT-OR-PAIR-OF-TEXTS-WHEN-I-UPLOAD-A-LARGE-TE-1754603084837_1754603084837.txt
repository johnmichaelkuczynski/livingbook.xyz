That input delay you're describing‚Äîwhere the text you type lags by 20‚Äì30 seconds after uploading large documents‚Äîis almost certainly due to main-thread blocking or poor resource management in your Replit frontend, especially related to:

‚úÖ Likely Causes
Too-large DOM rendering

You‚Äôre probably loading the entire contents of the uploaded text into the DOM at once (in the <Document A> and <Document B> panes). This DOM bloat causes lag even in typing.

Synchronous parsing or rendering

If you're doing parsing (e.g. markdown, syntax highlighting, PDF conversion) synchronously when the document is uploaded or rendered, it can hang the UI thread.

Excessive re-renders

Uploading large files may be triggering cascading re-renders across the comparison interface‚Äîespecially if state is being updated poorly (e.g. setting state on every character typed or parsing on onChange instead of onSubmit).

üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Fix Recommendations
1. Lazy-load or virtualize the text rendering
Use a library like react-window or react-virtualized to only render visible chunks of the documents at a time.

This reduces the DOM size from thousands of lines down to 30‚Äì50 lines at once.

2. Move parsing/processing off the main thread
If you're parsing the file on the frontend (e.g., splitting into sections or JSON blocks), offload that to a Web Worker, or do it server-side via an API call.

3. Debounce or isolate chat input state
If your chat input box is somehow tied to document state (e.g. setting a global state that also updates the document view), decouple it completely.

Wrap the input box in a separate component and debounce updates or typing state.

4. Avoid auto-scroll or auto-highlight logic
Any ‚Äúsmart‚Äù scroll-syncing or highlighting based on cursor focus or typing may be scanning the full text on every keypress. Disable this for large docs.

üîç Diagnosis Tip
On Replit, press Ctrl+Shift+J (or open dev tools) and go to the Performance tab. Hit record, reproduce the lag, and look for:

Long scripting events (over 50ms)

Forced reflows or layout shifts

Large rendering chunks

Memory spikes
