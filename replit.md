# DocMath AI - Document Processing & AI Chat

## Overview

DocMath AI is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload documents (PDF, Word, TXT) and interact with their content through an AI-powered chat interface. The application specializes in processing mathematical content with proper notation rendering, making it ideal for educational and academic use cases.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite with React plugin

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **File Processing**: Multer for file uploads with support for PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for document analysis and chat responses
- **Development**: Hot module replacement via Vite integration

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations
- **Development Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for development/testing

### Authentication and Authorization
- Currently using a simplified storage interface without authentication
- Prepared for user management with user schema defined
- Session management ready for implementation

## Key Components

### Document Processing Pipeline
1. **File Upload**: Multer handles file validation and temporary storage
2. **Text Extraction**: Service layer processes different file types
3. **Math Notation Processing**: Custom utilities identify and format mathematical expressions
4. **Storage**: Documents stored in PostgreSQL with metadata

### AI Chat System
1. **Chat Sessions**: Each document gets its own chat session
2. **Message Threading**: Complete conversation history maintained
3. **Context-Aware Responses**: AI has access to full document content
4. **Math-Focused Prompting**: System prompts optimized for mathematical content explanation

### UI Components
- **FileUpload**: Drag-and-drop interface with file validation
- **DocumentViewer**: Scrollable text display with math notation rendering
- **ChatInterface**: Real-time chat with typing indicators and message history
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with grid layouts

## Data Flow

### Document Upload Flow
1. User selects/drops file → FileUpload component
2. File validated against allowed types (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
3. Multer processes upload → temporary file storage
4. Document service extracts text content
5. Math notation processor enhances formatting
6. Document stored in database with metadata
7. UI updates with processed document

### Chat Interaction Flow
1. User sends message → ChatInterface component
2. Message stored in database with session context
3. OpenAI service receives message + document content + conversation history
4. AI generates contextual response focused on document content
5. Response stored and displayed in real-time
6. Query client invalidates cache for fresh data
