# DocMath AI - Document Processing & AI Chat

## Overview

DocMath AI is a streamlined document processing web application focused on text selection and AI-powered contextual analysis. The application now prioritizes core functionality: users can upload documents, select specific text passages, and ask AI questions about their selections. All complex modal features have been removed to focus on the essential text selection workflow.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)
